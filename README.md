Transfer learning is a technique that involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a new task. Since the pre-trained model has already learned features from a large dataset, it can be used as a starting point for a new task, even if the new task involves a different set of classes.

To use transfer learning for your new task, you can take the pre-trained model and replace the last layer(s) with new layers that are tailored to your new classification task. For example, you could replace the output layer of the pre-trained model, which is likely set up for classifying cars and trucks, with a new output layer that is set up for classifying dogs and cats.

You may also need to fine-tune some of the earlier layers in the network to adapt to the new task, depending on how similar the new dataset is to the original dataset used to train the pre-trained model.

Overall, using transfer learning can help you achieve better performance on your new classification task with less training data and time.
